A locksmith can open car doors, hot-wire autos, jimmy library windows, figure out Chinese puzzle boxes, and penetrate ordinary commercial alarm systems. The user may repair locks, make keys, or open locks with the aid of skeleton keys, picks, and other tools. Especially difficult locks may requrie a higher difficulty level.

Although cheaper combination locks can sometimes be "felt" and opened successfully, higher quality combinations found on safes and vaults are impervious to this method. The usual method is to steal the entire safe, taking it to a "quiet" location where time can be spent "peeling" it with torches, crowbars, and hammers. Large vaults are often more easily entered through one of the walls than through the securely locked door.
