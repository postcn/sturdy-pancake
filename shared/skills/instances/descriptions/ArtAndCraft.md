The investigator sheet contains blank spaces for specializations of this skill, for example:

*Acting*, *Barber*, *Carpenter*, *Cobbler*, *Cook*, *Dancer*, *Fine Art*, *Forgery*, *Morris Dancer*, *Opera Singer*, *Painter & Decorator*, *Photographer*, *Potter*, *Sculptor*, *Writer*, *Woodwork*

Many of these examples are skills directly linked to a profession, but the skill may just be a leisure pursuit. You may spend skill points to purchase any skill specialization. The generic Art and Craft skill cannot be purchased. 

A specialization enables the making or repair of items, something typically requiring equipment and time, to be determined by the Keeper if necessary. Higher levels of success may indicate a higher quality or precision item.

 An art or craft skill may be used to make a duplicate or fake item. In such a case, the difficulty level would depend on the intricacy and distinctiveness of the original to be copied. In the case of faking documentation, a specific specialization (Forgery) is used.
 
 A successful roll might provide information about an item, such as where or when it might have been made, some point of history or technique concerning it, or who might have made it. The holder of a specialization would have a breadth of knowledge within a particular field - knowledge of the subject, it's history and contemporary practitioners, as well as the ability to perform it.
