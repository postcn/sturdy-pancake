When choosing this skill, the exact language must be specified and written next to the skill. An individual can know any number of languages. The skill represents the user's chance to understand, speak, read, and write in a language other than his or her own.

Ancient or unknown languages (such as Aklo, Hyperborean, etc.) should not be chosen (unless agrred with the Keeper,) but ordinary Earthly languages may be. The Keeper may raise the difficulty level if archaic speech or writing in that language is encountered. A single successful Other Language roll normally allows comprehension of an entire book.

Suggestions regarding the Other Languages skill:

* At 5% skill a language can be correctly identified without need for roll
* At 10% skill simple ideas can be communicated
* At 30% transactional requests can be understood
* At 50% skill a person is fluent
* At 75% skill a character can pass for a native speaker of a foreign language
* To identify a present-day human language (unknown to the investigator), use an EDU roll.
* To identify an extinct human language, use an Archaeology or History roll
* To identify an alien language, use a Cthulhu Mythos or possibly an Occult roll
