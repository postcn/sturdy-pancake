Allows the user to find his or her way in storms or clear weather, in day or at night. Those of higher skill are familiar with astronomical tables, charts, instruments, and satellite location gear as they exist in the era of play. One could also use this skill to measure and map an area (cartography), whether an island of many square miles or the interior of a single room - use of modern technology may lower or negate the difficulty level.

Rolls for this skill may be made as concealed rolls by the Keeper - a matter for the investigators to attempt, and later witness the results.

If the character is familiar with the area, a bonus die should be granted to the roll.
