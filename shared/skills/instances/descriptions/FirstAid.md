The user is able to provide emergency medical care. This might encompass: applying a split to a broken leg, stemming bleeding, treating a burn, resuscitating a drowning victim, dressing and cleaning a wound, etc. First Aid cannot be used to treat diseases (where the Medicine skill is required).

To be effective, First Aid must be delivered within one hour, in which case it grants 1 hit point. It may be attempted once, with subsequent attempts constituting a pushed roll. Two people can work together to administer First Aid, wth a success granted if either one of them rolls a success. Successful use of First Aid can rouse an unconscious person to consciousness. A character is limited to one successful treatment of First Aid and Medicine until further damage is taken.

When treating a dying character, successful First Aid stabilizes him or her for one hour and grants 1 temporary hit point. At the end of the hour, and each hour thereafter, the character must make a successful CON roll to remain stabilized, otherwise (with a failed CON roll) the character is dying and loses the temporary hit point, and must now make a CON roll per round thereafter to stave-off death. If the character survives until the following round, First Aid can be attempted again (by up to two individuals). This can be continued (without constituting a pushed roll) until stabilization or death.

First Aid (and only First Aid) can save the life of a dying character, after which they must receive a successful Medicine roll, or be hospitalized. Thus, First Aid is an important skill to have, alongside Medicine, if you wish to be an effective medic.
