This skill allows a character to climb trees, walls, and other vertical surfaces with or without climbing gear. This skill also encompasses rapelling. 

Conditions, such as firmness of surface, available handholds, wind, visibility, rain, etc., may all affect the difficulty level.

Failing this skill on the first roll indicates that the climb is perhaps beyond the investigator's capability. Failing a pushed roll is likely to indicate a fall with resultant damage. One successful Climb roll should allow the investigator to complete the climb in almost all cases (rather than requiring repeated rolls). A challenging or longer climb should have an increased difficulty level.
