Library Use enables an investigator to find a piece of information, such as a certain book, newspaper, or reference in a library, collection of documents, or database, assuming the item is there. Use of this skill marks several hours of continuous search.

This skill can locate a locked case or rare-book special collection, but Persuade, Fast Talk, Charm, Intimidate, Credit Rating, or special credentials may have to be used to get access to the books or information in question.

**1920's Library Use**

Public libraries abound in the 1920s, even in small towns, where many of them were funded by the Carnegie Institute and other organizations. Althugh readily available, their resources are limited. Most large American cities have creditable public collections, particulary New York and Boston. Universities maintain large libraries, some of them with renowned collections. Although borrowing is limited, most offer access to the public, whether enrolled in the school or not.
