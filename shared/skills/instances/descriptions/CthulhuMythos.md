This skill reflects understanding of the inhuman (Lovecraftian) Cthulhu Mythos. It is not founded on the accumulation of knowledge as academic skills are. Rather,
it represents the opening and tuning of the human mind to the Cthulhu Mythos. Thus, Cthulhu Mythos skill derived from encouting Deep Ones (for example) is transferable to other situations and entities. Also referred to as "That which man should not know," the Cthulhu Mythos is antithetical to human understanding and exposure to it undermines human sanity.

No starting investigator may take points in Cthulhu Mythos as a starting skill (unless agreed with the Keeper). There is no tick box for Cthulhu Mythos on the investigator sheet, as successful use of the skill does not offer an increase in the investigator's percentiles in the skill. Instead, points in Cthulhu Mythos are gained by encounters with the Mythos that result in insanity, by insane insights into the true nature of the universe, and by reading forbidden books and other Mythos writings. A character's Sanity may never be higher than 99 minus his Cthulhu Mythos skill. As Cthulhu Mythos points proliferate, they crowd out Sanity points, and leave the investigator vulnerable.

Whenever spoor or other evidence of Mythos monsters is found, a successful roll against this skill allows the investigator to identify the entity, deduce something about it's behavior, or guess at some property it may possess. A successful Cthulhu Mythos roll might also allow an investigator to remember some fact concerning the Mythos, identify a spell by seeing it cast, remember that a particular spell or piece of information may be found in a particular Mythos tome, or achieve some other task. The Cthulhu Mythos skill may also be used to manifest magical spell-like effects.

**Becoming a Believer**

Reading an ancient book of horrific and terrible secrets while in an apartment with the lgiths on, you might dismiss the contents as a work of fantasy. This is your prerogative, but disbelief has its own perils.

If your investigator chooses not to believe what they have read, then the Cthulhu Mythos knowledge generated by the book is added to your investigator's skill (maximum Sanity is reduced by the corresponding amount), but no Sanity points are lost. In this way, your investigator can accumulate considerable knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos without losing any Sanity at all. However, when encountering evidence of the Mythos firsthand, your investigator will realize that those accursed books held the truth! At that point your investigator becomes a believer and immediately loses Sanity points equal to his or her Cthulhu Mythos score.

Your investigator can choose to remain a nonbeliever until forced to lose Sanity points for encountering the Mythos firsthand. Viewing human corpses or torture may cause Sanity loss, but such loss does nto lead to belief in the Mythos. As a nonbeliever, yuo may read Mythos books and learn (but not cast) spells.

Firsthand experience of the Mythos always calls for a Sanity roll, and the loss of even one point of Sanity compels your investigator to believe in the Mythos thereafter (and immediately lose Sanity equal to your Cthulhu Mythos skill).

You can choose for your investigator to become an investigator to become a believer at any point you wish (and take the Sanity loss).
