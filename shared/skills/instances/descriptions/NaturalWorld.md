Originally the study of plant and animal life in its environment. By the nineteenth century, this study had long since separated into a long range of academic disciplines (Biology, Botany, etc.) As a skill, Natural World represents the traditional (unscientific) knowledge and personal observation of farmers, fishermen, inspired amateurs, and hobbyists. It can identify species, habits, and habitats in a general way, and identify tracks, spoors, and calls, as well as allowing guesses as to what may be important to a particular species. For a scientific understanding of the natural world, one should look to the Biology, Botany, or Zoology skills.

Natural World may or may not be accurate - this is the region of appreciation, judgement, folk tradition, and enthusiasm. Use Natural World to judge horseflesh at the county fair, or decide whether a butterfly collection is excellent or just excellently framed.
