With this skill the user is familiar in the safe use of demolitions, including setting and defusing explosive charges. Mines and similar devices are designed to be easy to set (no roll required) and more difficult to remove or defuse. 

This skill also encompasses military-grade demolitions (anti-personnel mines, plastique, etc.)

Given enough time and resources, those proficient may rig charges to demolish a building, clear a blocked tunnel, and repurpose explosive devises (such as constructing low-yield charges, booby-traps, and so on).
