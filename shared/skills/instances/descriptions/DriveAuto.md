Anyone with this skill can drive a car or light truck, make ordinary maneuvers, and cope with ordinary vehicle problems. If the investigator wants to lose a pursuer or tail someone, a Drive roll would be appropriate. 

Some other cultures might replace this skill with a comparative one: the Inuit might use Drive Dogsled, or a Victorian might use Drive Carriage.

In the U.S. drivers are licensed by the individual states. Most require a minimum age of 16, although there are exceptions, especially regarding the use of farm vehicles by underage persons in conjunction with the work of the farm. To obtain a license, a short simple written test must first be passed, followed by a brief road test in the presence of a police officer. Passing both tests and the payment of a fee results in a license, usually good for one to two years before needing renewal. Driver's licenses are valid in other states but can be revoked by a judge if the driver is repeatedly ticketed for unsafe practices.

In Great Britain, the Motor Car Act of 1903 introduced the driving license, as well as registration numbers for vehicles, and speed limit of 20mph. The Roads Act of 1920 required councils to register all vehicles at the time fo licensing. Driving tests, however, were not necessary or compulsory until 1935.
