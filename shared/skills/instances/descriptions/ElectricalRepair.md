Enables the investigator to repair or reconfigure electrical equipment, such as auto ignitions, electric motors, fuse boxes, and burglar alarms. In the present day, this skill has little to do with the Electronics Skill. Fixing an electrical device may require special parts or tools. Jobs inthe 1920s may call for this skill and Mechanical Repair in combination. 

Electrical Repair may also be used in conjunction withmodern explosives, such as blasting caps, C-4 plastic explosives, and mines. These weapons are designed to deploy; only a fumble result will lead to misfire (remember the roll can be pushed). Defusing explosives is far trickier, as they may be fitted with anti-tamper mechanisms; raise the difficulty when disarming explosives - see Demolitions skill.

**1920s Electrical Repair**

Most repair jobs in the early 1920s require only knowledge of motors and generators, lighting and heating systems, and the comparatively simple circuitry of these automobiles and burglar alarms. These sorts of tasks could be logically be handled by the Mechanical Repiar skill, and it is suggested taht the one skill be used for both mechanical and simple electrical repairs. By the end of the decade, however, the radio business is booming and television is already in its infancy. Repairing these devices calls for the Electrical Repair skill. Numerous schools and correspondence courses abound, offering to teach these "vital new skills." Even courses on television are available, *Popular Science* and *Modern Electronics* (the latter founded in 1908) are both monthly periodicals devoted to new developments in technology.
