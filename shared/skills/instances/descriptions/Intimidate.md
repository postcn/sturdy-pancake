Intimidation can take many forms, including physical force, psychological manipulation, and threats. It is used to frighten or compel a person to act in a certain way. Intimidate is opposed by Intimidate or Psychology. 

Backing up intimidation with a weapon or some other powerful threat or incentive may reduce the difficulty level. When pushing an Intimidation roll, one possible consequence of failure is carrying out one's threat , perhaps beyond the level of that which was intended.

Intimidate may be used to force down the price of an item or service. If successful, the seller may reduce the price, or handle the item over free of charge - depending on the situation, they may later report the incident to the police or to members of the local organized crime gang.
