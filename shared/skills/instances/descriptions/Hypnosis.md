The user is able to induce a trancelike state in a willing target who experiences heightened suggestibility, relaxation, and possible recall of forgotten memories. The limits of hypnotism should be decided by the Keeper to fit their game; it may be that only willing subjects can be hypnotized, or the Keeper may allow it to be used on unwilling targets in a more aggressive manner. Using hypnosis is usually an opposed roll (opposed by the POW or Psychology skill of the target).

This skill may be utilized as hypnotheraphy on those suffering mental trauma, reducing the effects of a phobia or mania in a patient; successful hypnotherapy sessions may be needed to fully cure someone of a phobia (minimum of 1D6 sessions, at the Keeper's discretion).
