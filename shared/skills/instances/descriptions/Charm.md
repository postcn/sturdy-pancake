Charm takes many forms, including physical attraction, seduction, flattery, or simply warmth of personality. Charm may be used to compel someone to act in a certain way, but not in a manner completely contrary to that person's normal behavior. Charm is opposed by the Charm or Psychology skills. 

Charm may be used for bargaining, to haggle the price of an item or service down. If successful, the seller is won over and they may well reduce the price a little. 

Remember this about being charming: if the investigator begins to take a different approach, the Keeper may ask for a different skill to be used; if threats are used it may become Intimidation; or if a protacted discussion ensues, it may become Persuasion. Switching from one to the other to gain a second roll still constitutes a pushed roll.

**Persuade, Fast Talk, Intimidate, and Charm: Disambiguation**

The relative values in these skills serve to define a character and how they interact with people.

It is not for the player to nominate which one of these four skills they are using in a given situation. Instead the player should describe what their investigator is doign and saying, and it is then up to the Keeper to decide which of the four skills is appropriate.

* If the investigator is threatening violence or acting aggresively, the skill is **Intimidate**
* If the investigator is attempting to befriend or seduce, the skill is **Charm**
* If the investigator is using ratioanl arguments and debate over a prolonged time, the skill is **Persuade**
* If the investigator is acting quickly to deceive, con, or trick, the skill is **Fast Talk**

**When Used on Player Characters**

Each player (normally) has only one investigator through which they act in the game; it would therefore not be fair to allow one player to dictate the actions of another player's investigator. However, if one player wishes to put pressure on another player's investigator to do their bidding, they might use violence (combat rules) or their investigator's social skills. The former could inflict damage and ultimately death; the latter is subtler.

When one of these four skills is successfully use on an investigator (either by a non-player character or another investigator), the player is not compelled to follow the wishes of the other party. If the player refuses to act in accordance with the wishes of the character who coerced them, the latter can inflict one penalty die on one dice roll (of the coercer's choice) made by the player of the coerced investigator. This penalty die need not be applied to the very next dice roll, but does not last indefinitely. Only one penalty die can be held by one character against any other single character at a time.
