A measure of how prosperous and financially confident the investigator appears to be.
Money opens doors; if the investigator is attempting to use his or her financial
status to achieve a goal then use of the Credit Rating skill may be appropriate.
Credit Rating can be used in place of APP to gauge first impressions. (i.e wealthier
people tend to dress in more expensive clothing).
Credit Rating is not so much a skill as a gauge of financial wealth, and should not
be ticked as other skills are. A high Credit Rating can be a useful resource in play,
and so should be paid for with skill points when creating an investigator. Each
occupation has a starting range for Credit Rating, and skill points should be spent to
achieve a range therein.
Call of Cthulhu is not a game that requires money to be carefully tracked; however,
it is useful to know the bounds of an investigator's financial reach - for example,
can the investigator afford to employ a team of archaelogists and workers to excavate
an Egyptian tomb? An investigator's Credit Rating can change over time. Investigators
of the Cthulhu Mythos are prone to insanity, and this may lead to loss of employment
and thus a lowering of the investigator's Credit Rating score.
